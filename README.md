## Ontology
These are three University of Rochester juniors. The odd student out is differentiated by major. Two are Digital Media Studies majors, while the third is a Mechanical Engineering major. 

## Taxonomy
### Introduction
Each student's section begins with an introduction of themselves - who they are, where they're from, and some of their interests and passions.
### College Years
The next section talks about their experience at the University of Rochester, such as the courses they've taken and how they landed on their major. 
### Work Experience
This last section discusses the experiences students have had out in the real world. 
### Sources
This gives credit for the content from the students' original Assignment 2 page. 

## Choreography
The three students are arranged in alphabetical order by last name. This also allows for the two students with something in common (majoring in Digital Media Studies) to be placed consecutively. 
The subsections for each student are arranged in order of importance. The introduction gives an overview, then we focus on college years because that's where they're at now. Work experience comes after since that's something that comes secondary to education right now in their lives.
